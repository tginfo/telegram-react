### Technical details

The app is based on the ReactJS JavaScript framework and TDLib (Telegram Database library) compiled to WebAssembly. Try it [here](https://web.tginfo.me).

Original repo is here: https://github.com/evgeny-nadymov/telegram-react

### Running locally
Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

Install dependencies with:

```lang=bash
npm install
```

This will install all the needed dependencies.

All TDLib files will be installed into node_modules/tdweb/dist/ folder. Manually copy them into the public folder with:

```lang=bash
cp node_modules/tdweb/dist/* public/
```

Run the app in development mode with:

```lang=bash
npm run start
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. **Update *homepage* property at the app's `package.json` file.**

Define its value to be the string `http://{username}.github.io/{repo-name}`, where `{username}` is your GitHub username, and `{repo-name}` is the name of the GitHub repository. Since our GitHub username is `tginfo` and the name of our GitHub repository is `telegram-react`, I added the following property:
    
```js
//...
"homepage": "http://tginfo.github.io/telegram-react"
```
    
2. **Generate a *production build* of your app and deploy it to GitHub Pages.**

```
$ npm run deploy
```
